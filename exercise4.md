# Exercise 4

Short text about the advantages of Unit tests and explanation of my unit tests

## Why Unit tests are useful

Unit tests are a great way to catch bugs early.
You can write them fairly easy and use them to quickly check your program for possible bugs.
These tests are also a good opportunity to test your code for every possible edge case that could occur.

## JUnit testing for Calculator Class

I wrote three tests for the methods add(), subtract(), multiply() and divide() in my CalculatorTest class to test the functionality of my Calculator class.
For these methods I tested three cases:
 - calling method with two positive numbers
 - calling method with one positive and one negative number
 - calling method with one positve number and zero

To test my factorial() method I wrote three tests to:
 - test factorial with a negative number
 - test factorial with 0
 - test factorial with a positive number
